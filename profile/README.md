## 🎯 Core competencies

Since our founding, we have focused on developing web applications, both as a primary and secondary activity.
Over the past two years, we have shifted our focus to software solutions that facilitate the migration of data from legacy systems to modern platforms.
Additionally, we provide comprehensive services for active network components like switches, access points and firewalls.

## 🌍 Open source participation

> If everyone is willing to contribute no one has to pay

According to this principle, we always try to make our intellectual property freely available whenever possible. Also privately we support projects and developers whose work we appreciate for example:
